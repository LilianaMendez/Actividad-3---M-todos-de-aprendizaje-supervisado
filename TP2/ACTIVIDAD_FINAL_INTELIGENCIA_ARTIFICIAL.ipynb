              "509   I had been hinting at a digital camera for Christmas but was surprised when my husband actually got one  After talking to several people  both sales people and those that had digital cameras  he chose the Olympus D 490 Zoom  It s been very easy to figure out with the help of the manual  The manual itself is easy to understand and it s not difficult to find something if I have a question  The camera can be used in two different ways  You can simply open the cover and point and shoot  or you can also open the lens cover and view your subjects through the monitor  much like looking through a cam corder screen  So far the pictures have been of good quality  though I haven t tried to print one out yet  Because my main objective at this point is to email pictures to friends and family I can choose a lower resolution setting and get more pictures at a time  but if I chose to print it s very easy to change the settings to a higher resolution  I d like to have a few of the accessories but the camera works just fine without them  they would just make the download to my computer easier and faster  I have an older computer so it takes a couple of minutes to download but not so long that it gets frustrating    \n",

              "110   Having looked around the Web for a digital camera I was looking at either the Z1 or the Canon EOD300 Rebel  Unfortunately the Rebel was out of my price range so I bought the Z1  Overall I made a very good choice The camera takes good pictures in the majority of circumstances  You can have full control over the aperture  exposure and focus should you wish too  The camera can take over some or all of the functions too if you wish Low light shooting is easy and there is an option for sunset preserve to keep the warmth of a picture rather than overexpose to simulate full light  Fast moving objects need good light  as you would expect  but the camera can still operate at speeds approaching 1600 ISO  the speeds are quoted in seconds and fractions so you will have to convert to ISO yourself if you are that way inclined Night shooting is an exercise in steadyness and the threaded mount is inline with the lens so tripods are easy to attach and use with the camera  The position of the trigger means taht a decent push is needed often spoiling the shot through movement on the tripod  I tended to use the time delay function after lining the shot up  since the exposur time was generally 2 seconds you wouldnt be able to take moment in time shots anyway as you would blur  however if motion blur was wanted for a set time then the lack of a remote may hinder you The flash was good with the red eye reduction setting annoying  3 distinct flashes are used rather than the usual strobe  but effective The viewfinder shows a full picture but it has an obvious border so you will get more than you see  The LCD screen shows the full picture  observed by me not scientifically proved  The viewfinder and LCD screen are served by the same mechanism and therefore cannot be activated at the same time  Long exposure shots are restricted to 10 seconds maximum  the sensor simply cannot take long exposure  I typically call long exposure at least 1 minute with traditional cameras taking maybe 30 minutes onwards  This is not a fault of the camera as most digital cameras suffer the same fate of  overheated  CCDs  Only the EOD300 can have long exposures  I have seen a 10 minute exposure picture  for a budget camera 10x optical zoom is terrific and even the autofocus at maximum zoom is quick and efficient  A certain knack needs to be adopted with the camera since the shutter trigger is a two position button  A half press will continually focus and a full press will take the picture  therefore if you simply press the button the shutter will appear to be slow since the focusing mechanism will kick in before the picture is taken  If you are anticipating a fast shot then half hold the button to activate the autofocus then the shutter can be activated quickly  Usign this methods the camer was faultless and fast I have never been a fan of megapixels to rate a camera  Rather the resolutions on offer are good and true  2048 scale very well   but dont expect many per a 128Mb card never mind the bundled 16Mb  Colour reproduction is faithful on daylight shots and average for evening shots with maybe a hint of overglow Battery life is great on rechargeables  I got 300 shots from a set of 2100 NIMH before they needed charging and I was using autofocus and zoom a lot  however if you use alkalines then expect 200 before the batteries are drained   note they wont be useless  good enough for remotes or clocks  but they have lost the edge for the drain the camera needs For negative points  the build quality is average  The mechanican shutter jammed on my only 1 week into using it  I couldnt shift between LCD and viewfinder and a heavy press was needed on the back screen to release the shutter  Not good  The battery compartment seems VERY flimsy and I worry about breaking it everytime I use it  and I charge my batteries in a smart charger not internally  No AC supply is included but the majority of people who need one will have a regulated supply to hand anyway The lack of remote function is the only noteable omission from a rather useful bargain camera    \n",

              "' Having looked around the Web for a digital camera I was looking at either the Z1 or the Canon EOD300 Rebel  Unfortunately the Rebel was out of my price range so I bought the Z1  Overall I made a very good choice The camera takes good pictures in the majority of circumstances  You can have full control over the aperture  exposure and focus should you wish too  The camera can take over some or all of the functions too if you wish Low light shooting is easy and there is an option for sunset preserve to keep the warmth of a picture rather than overexpose to simulate full light  Fast moving objects need good light  as you would expect  but the camera can still operate at speeds approaching 1600 ISO  the speeds are quoted in seconds and fractions so you will have to convert to ISO yourself if you are that way inclined Night shooting is an exercise in steadyness and the threaded mount is inline with the lens so tripods are easy to attach and use with the camera  The position of the trigger means taht a decent push is needed often spoiling the shot through movement on the tripod  I tended to use the time delay function after lining the shot up  since the exposur time was generally 2 seconds you wouldnt be able to take moment in time shots anyway as you would blur  however if motion blur was wanted for a set time then the lack of a remote may hinder you The flash was good with the red eye reduction setting annoying  3 distinct flashes are used rather than the usual strobe  but effective The viewfinder shows a full picture but it has an obvious border so you will get more than you see  The LCD screen shows the full picture  observed by me not scientifically proved  The viewfinder and LCD screen are served by the same mechanism and therefore cannot be activated at the same time  Long exposure shots are restricted to 10 seconds maximum  the sensor simply cannot take long exposure  I typically call long exposure at least 1 minute with traditional cameras taking maybe 30 minutes onwards  This is not a fault of the camera as most digital cameras suffer the same fate of  overheated  CCDs  Only the EOD300 can have long exposures  I have seen a 10 minute exposure picture  for a budget camera 10x optical zoom is terrific and even the autofocus at maximum zoom is quick and efficient  A certain knack needs to be adopted with the camera since the shutter trigger is a two position button  A half press will continually focus and a full press will take the picture  therefore if you simply press the button the shutter will appear to be slow since the focusing mechanism will kick in before the picture is taken  If you are anticipating a fast shot then half hold the button to activate the autofocus then the shutter can be activated quickly  Usign this methods the camer was faultless and fast I have never been a fan of megapixels to rate a camera  Rather the resolutions on offer are good and true  2048 scale very well   but dont expect many per a 128Mb card never mind the bundled 16Mb  Colour reproduction is faithful on daylight shots and average for evening shots with maybe a hint of overglow Battery life is great on rechargeables  I got 300 shots from a set of 2100 NIMH before they needed charging and I was using autofocus and zoom a lot  however if you use alkalines then expect 200 before the batteries are drained   note they wont be useless  good enough for remotes or clocks  but they have lost the edge for the drain the camera needs For negative points  the build quality is average  The mechanican shutter jammed on my only 1 week into using it  I couldnt shift between LCD and viewfinder and a heavy press was needed on the back screen to release the shutter  Not good  The battery compartment seems VERY flimsy and I worry about breaking it everytime I use it  and I charge my batteries in a smart charger not internally  No AC supply is included but the majority of people who need one will have a regulated supply to hand anyway The lack of remote function is the only noteable omission from a rather useful bargain camera  '"
